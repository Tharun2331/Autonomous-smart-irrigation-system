# Autonomous-smart-irrigation-system


Overview:
Agriculture is the backbone of the Indian Economy. In todayâ€™s world, as we see rapid growth in global
population, agriculture becomes more important to meet the needs of the human race. However,
agriculture requires irrigation and with every year we have more water consumption than rainfall, it
becomes critical for growers to find ways to conserve water while still achieving the highest yield.
However, IoT is changing the agriculture domain and empowering farmers to fight with the huge
difficulties they face. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a technology where a mobile device can be used
to monitor the function of a device. IOT is a type of network technology, which senses the information
from different sensors and makes anything to join the Internet to exchange information.

The proposed system has been designed to overcome the unnecessary water flow into the agricultural
lands. Temperature, moisture and humidity readings are continuously monitored by using temperature,
moisture and humidity sensors and send these values to the assigned IP address. Android application
continuously collects the data from that assigned IP address. Once the soil moisture values have
exceeded the particular limit then the relay, which is connected to the ESP32 controls the motor.
